Hello! Welcome to my personal page.

Currently I work for Shell as a data scientist based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Before joining Shell, I was a PhD researcher at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). A quick view of what my research is about is available [here](../post/phd). To get to know more about my background and experiences, check out my Linkedin profile :point_left:.

Because of my education and work experiences, traveling has become a big part of my life. In the past decade, I have lived in a different countries, including China, US, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands, and have traveled to many other places, such as India, Egypt, UK. Traveling :train::car::airplane::ship: has certainly enriched my life a lot.
