Entitled ["**Data-driven Analysis and Modeling of Public Transport Passenger Flows and Service Networks**"](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Aebc2f602-a65b-491c-805f-9fb4f37cb104),
my PhD dissertation is about researching methods and models for developing insights into complex dynamics of public transport systems.
These insights, which are unlocked through advanced data analytics, can be used to improve public
transport planning and operations for building a better passenger mobility system for our society.
