Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. I am a (researcher-turned) data scientist based in the Netherlands.
Currently I work for Shell primarily in the space of E-Mobility data analytics. I joined Shell as an [AI resident](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/digitalisation/digital-technologies/shell-ai/shell-ai-residency-programme.html) straight
after after completing my PhD program at TU Delft. Check out the [research page](../research) for more details about what I did to earn
the title of Dr.

In addition to my full-time role, I am also a guest researcher hosted by TU Delft's
[AI for Mobility (AIM) Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/aim). The main purpose of this 0-fte role is to seek research and education collaboration 
opportunities at the intersection of data science, energy and mobility.

- [My-TRAC](http://www.my-trac.eu/): research and development of user-centric services to enhance the passenger multimodal door-to-door experience

My technology experience includes:
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Cloud Platforms**: Azure (DevOps, Databricks, Data Lake Storage, Machine Learning), AWS, GCP
- **Data Analytics**: pandas, PySpark, NumPy, networkx, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Geospatial Anlaytics**: OpenStreetMap (osmnx, osrm), geopandas
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, dash, plotly, kepler.gl
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git
