Currently I am a data scientist at [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Together with many other excellent colleagues, I try to come up with various data science solutions to help this traditional oil and energy company achieve **digital transformation**, which eventually contributes to the ongoing [**energy transition**](https://www.irena.org/energytransition).  

Before joining Shell, I was a PhD researcher at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). A quick view of what my research is about is available [here](../post/phd).

I did my master's and bachelor's at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) and [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/), respectively. To get to know more about my background and experiences, check out my Linkedin profile :point_left: or my [CV:page_facing_up:](https://github.com/dingdl/cv).

Because of my education and work experiences, traveling :train::car::airplane::ship: has become a big part of my life in the past decade, during which I have lived in places like Beijing, Shenzhen, Stockholm, New York City, Delft and Melbourne, and have traveled to many other places. I hope one day I can travel to more than 100 countries (right now 27).

I like various sports, particularly :basketball:. And the Netherlands is a very good place for :bicyclist:.
