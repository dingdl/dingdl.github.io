Currently I am a data scientist at [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Together with many other excellent colleagues, I try to come up with various data science solutions to help Shell achieve **digital transformation**, which eventually contributes to the ongoing [**energy transition**](https://www.irena.org/energytransition).  

Before joining Shell, I was a PhD researcher at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). A quick view of what my research is about is available [here](../post/phd). To get to know more about my background and experiences, check out my Linkedin profile :point_left: or my [CV:page_facing_up:](https://github.com/dingdl/cv).

Because of my education and work experiences, traveling has become a big part of my life. In the past decade, I have lived in a different countries, including China, US, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands, and have traveled to many other places, such as India, Egypt, UK. Traveling :train::car::airplane::ship: has certainly enriched my life a lot.

I like various sports, particularly :basketball:. Living in the Netherlands also makes me enjoy cycling :bicyclist:.
