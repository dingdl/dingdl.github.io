I began industrial data science career within the energy sector after earning my PhD from TU Delft in February 2020. 
Presently, I hold the position of Senior Data Scientist at Shell's Global People Analytics Team based in The Hague, Netherlands. 
Prior to this assignment, I worked across a few Shell businesses providing data science and digital solutions, with a special
emphasis on mobility electrification.

In my current capacity, my role is multifaceted, demanding a diverse array of skills and expertise. At the core of my 
responsibilities is the execution of advanced analytics on workforce and organizational dynamics, leveraging both HR and
business data to uncover insightful trends and patterns. In parallel, I spearhead the development of cloud-based digital tools, such as Plotly Dash applications, which are pivotal in enhancing decision-making processes within HR.

This position affords me the unique opportunity to meld and expand upon my technical proficiency with strategic acumen. 
It's a role that not only draws upon my background in data science but also allows me to contribute meaningfully to the 
evolution of HR practices through innovative technological solutions.
