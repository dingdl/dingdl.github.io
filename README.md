Use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build my personal website.

## How to update the content

#### 0. Have Hugo on the computer in the minimal way. 
Download `hugo_xxxxx_Windows-64bit.zip` from [hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Unzip the file and put the `hugo.exe` file in the root folder. To check the version of Hugo, enter the folder in terminal (e.g., powershell) and run `.\hugo.exe version`. You should be able to see something like `Hugo Static Site Generator v0.74.2-48565DE6 windows/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-07-17T17:22:50Z`.
