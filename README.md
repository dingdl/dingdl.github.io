# My personal website

Use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build my personal website.

## How to update the content

1. Have Hugo on the computer in the minimal way. Download `hugo_xxxxx_Windows-64bit.zip` from [hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Unzip the file and put the `hugo.exe` file in the root folder.
2. Enter the folder in terminal (e.g., powershell). To check the version of hugo, run `.\hugo.exe version`
